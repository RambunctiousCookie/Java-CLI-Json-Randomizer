# Java Command Line Interface Json Randomizer
This is a simple project that generates a randomized json output with configurable attributes and key-value data.

## Setup
Simply run Maven to install the required dependencies, and then run the project via `Main`.

## Technologies/Learning Points
1. Reflection: The enums located in `src/main/java/reflectionPractice/PersonValues` are automatically accessed by the program and printed to a reference file every time the program is run.
2. Recursion: The command-line functions for  `getValidIntegerInput()` leverage recursion using a simple base case.
